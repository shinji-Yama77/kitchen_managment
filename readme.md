The project is centered around keeping track of the inventory of your fridge (perishable items). The application allows the user to update and add, delete items from the fridge. It also automatically handles the subtraction of the quantity of ingredients when you apply a recipe. The user is not able to apply recipes that require ingredients that they do not have. The user is able to store and create recipes, as well as generate recipes based on the ingredients they have in the fridge. 




## Features


### Feature 1: Current Inventory

- Current inventory stores your ingredient/item name
- Current inventory stores your preferred measurement type (Weight, Volume, Count)
- Current inventory stores your quantity of the item in the unit you prefer based on measurement type
- Current inventory stores the category of your food based on food pyramid (protein, vegetables, dairy, grain) for filtering purposes
- Current inventory optionally stores the expiration date of your item

**Key points**

- Inventory has select options for the unit based on what measurement type you select for the item to simplify conversions

- Same measurement type allows for less conversion, less errors since cross measurement type calculation requires density for the specific food
