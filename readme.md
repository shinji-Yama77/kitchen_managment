### Project Idea


The project is centered around keeping track of the inventory of your fridge (perishable items). The application allows the user to update and add, delete items from the fridge. It also automatically handles the subtraction of the quantity of ingredients when you apply a recipe. The user is not able to apply recipes that require ingredients that they do not have. The user is able to store and create recipes, as well as generate recipes based on the ingredients they have in the fridge.
